FAQ
=======

*Q: Why do I get "Timestamp for this request is not valid"*

*A*: This occurs in 2 different cases.

The timestamp sent is outside of the serverTime - recvWindow value
The timestamp sent is more than 1000ms ahead of the server time

Check that your system time is in sync. See `this issue <https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance/issues/2#issuecomment-324878152>`_ for some sample code to check the difference between your local
time and the Binance server time.

*Q: Why do I get "Signature for this request is not valid"*

*A1*: One of your parameters may not be in the correct format.

Check recvWindow is an integer and not a string.

*A2*: You may need to regenerate your API Key and Secret

*A3*: You may be attempting to access the API from a Chinese IP address, these are now restricted by Binance.
