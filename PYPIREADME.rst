This is an unofficial Python wrapper for the `Binance exchange REST API v1 <https://www.binance.com/restapipub.html>`_. I am in no way affiliated with Binance. Use at your own risk.

If you came here looking for the `Binance exchange <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_ to purchase cryptocurrencies, then `go here <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_. If you want to automate interactions with Binance stick around.
