Welcome to python-binance-us v0.1
================================
**Forked from Sam McHardy's Python-Binance API**

**Please show him some love!**
----
Notes from Sam McHardy in upstream repo:

I am working on a python3 version with async support to remove legacy dependencies and their related issues.

I would appreciate if you could try out the `feature/asyncio <https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance/tree/feature/asyncio>`_ branch and give your feedback.


This is an unofficial Python wrapper for the `Binance US exchange REST API v1/3 <https://github.com/binance-us/binance-official-api-docs>`_. I am in no way affiliated with Binance, use at your own risk.

If you came here looking for the `Binance exchange <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_ to purchase cryptocurrencies, then `go here <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_. If you want to automate interactions with Binance stick around.

If you're interested in Binance's new DEX Binance Chain see Sam McHardy's `python-binance-chain library <https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance-chain>`_

.. code:: bash

    pip install python-binance


.. code:: python

    from binance.client import Client
    client = Client(api_key, api_secret)

    # get market depth
    depth = client.get_order_book(symbol='BNBBTC')

    # place a test market buy order, to place an actual order use the create_order function
    order = client.create_test_order(
        symbol='BNBBTC',
        side=Client.SIDE_BUY,
        type=Client.ORDER_TYPE_MARKET,
        quantity=100)

    # get all symbol prices
    prices = client.get_all_tickers()

    # withdraw 100 ETH
    # check docs for assumptions around withdrawals
    from binance.exceptions import BinanceAPIException, BinanceWithdrawException
    try:
        result = client.withdraw(
            asset='ETH',
            address='<eth_address>',
            amount=100)
    except BinanceAPIException as e:
        print(e)
    except BinanceWithdrawException as e:
        print(e)
    else:
        print("Success")

    # fetch list of withdrawals
    withdraws = client.get_withdraw_history()

    # fetch list of ETH withdrawals
    eth_withdraws = client.get_withdraw_history(asset='ETH')

    # get a deposit address for BTC
    address = client.get_deposit_address(asset='BTC')

    # start aggregated trade websocket for BNBBTC
    def process_message(msg):
        print("message type: {}".format(msg['e']))
        print(msg)
        # do something

    from binance.websockets import BinanceSocketManager
    bm = BinanceSocketManager(client)
    bm.start_aggtrade_socket('BNBBTC', process_message)
    bm.start()

    # get historical kline data from any date range

    # fetch 1 minute klines for the last day up until now
    klines = client.get_historical_klines("BNBBTC", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1MINUTE, "1 day ago UTC")

    # fetch 30 minute klines for the last month of 2017
    klines = client.get_historical_klines("ETHBTC", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_30MINUTE, "1 Dec, 2017", "1 Jan, 2018")

    # fetch weekly klines since it listed
    klines = client.get_historical_klines("NEOBTC", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1WEEK, "1 Jan, 2017")
