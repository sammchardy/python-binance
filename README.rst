This is an unofficial Python wrapper for the `Binance exchange REST API v3 <https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs>`_. I am in no way affiliated with Binance, use at your own risk.

If you came here looking for the `Binance exchange <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_ to purchase cryptocurrencies, then `go here <https://www.binance.com/?ref=10099792>`_. If you want to automate interactions with Binance stick around.

If you're interested in Binance's new DEX Binance Chain see my `python-binance-chain library <https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance-chain>`_

    from binance.websockets import BinanceSocketManager
    bm = BinanceSocketManager(client)
    bm.start_aggtrade_socket('BNBBTC', process_message)
    bm.start()

    # get historical kline data from any date range

    # fetch 1 minute klines for the last day up until now
    klines = client.get_historical_klines("BNBBTC", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1MINUTE, "1 day ago UTC")

    # fetch 30 minute klines for the last month of 2017
    klines = client.get_historical_klines("ETHBTC", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_30MINUTE, "1 Dec, 2017", "1 Jan, 2018")
